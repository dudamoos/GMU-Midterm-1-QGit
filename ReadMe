For this assignment, simulation-time was using instead of real-time because of
problems controlling the simulation in real-time. Since the simulation was
running at less than 15% of real-time speed, commanding the robot in real time
made it do ridiculous things like leaping off the ground when moving up and
down on one foot at the required rate. Additionally, as shown in the video,
the robot could not realistically lean forward more than 45 degrees (pi/4
radians). If it leaned forward any more (or went up/down any more) its leg
would collide with its waist, causing many problems which would usually result
in the robot toppling over.
